Description:
This project focuses on the creation and evaluation of an email classifier to distinguish between "spam" and "ham" (non-spam) emails. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques were employed to develop the classifier. Below, key aspects of the project are summarized:

Objective: The primary goal of the project was to create a classification model capable of automatically identifying spam and non-spam emails, which is essential for spam detection in email applications.

Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning
Logistic Regression as the classification algorithm
Text processing with regular expressions
Feature extraction using CountVectorizer
Model evaluation using accuracy metrics, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.
Key Results:

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 96.23% in classifying emails as spam or non-spam.
The top 10 relevant features associated with spam emails and the top 10 relevant features associated with non-spam emails were identified.
Lessons Learned: Throughout the project, skills in text processing, machine learning model creation, and performance evaluation were acquired.

Potential Application: This project has practical applications in automated spam detection in emails and can be useful for enhancing the efficiency and security of email communications.
